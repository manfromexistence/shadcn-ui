Hey, bro. So, I am 100% sure that I can do this project.
I am an experienced full-stack software engineer who loves learning new techs and making something useful. My skills list:

So, Thank you. Yes,  (ðŸ‘Š)you, my friend, made it this far. I personally use my bare hands using my bare... or just the keyboard... Keyboard made this proposal. Didn't use any chatGPT or any of those A's out there. So, I am hoping that you will find this proposal funny and If you think that your project needs someone like me then don't keep that thought in only at your mind and just message me in my account.

```
1. Frontend(WWW): Nextjs (React senior + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn ui framework -> I am constantly trying to put my own component here + Firebase)
2. Frontend(MOBILE): React Native + Flutter + Kotlin Android Studio + Swift iOS (I use Windows 10, so you know there are OS-related cons here)                                                                                                                                
3. Frontend(DESKTOP): Electron + Tauri + just the native Windows development + I use Windows so Linux and Mac are out of my reach now but I think I am capable of making an app for these OS also.
4. (OUT OF TOPICS): UNREAL v5(No, as I am saying I use a pc which doesn't have any GPU. So I cannot do anything related to this but I will soon buy a fresh GPU for my PC. So then I can do this  task also)                                                                  
5. Backend: Django + Elysia -> it is like Express but better + Laravel + and I am in an ongoing hunt to learn all useful backend technologies...                                                                                                                   
6. Blockchain: Solidity + Rust + currently exploring the new kinds of stuff in the blockchain space. I already know web3.js, ethers.js, Viem -> just like ehters.js but better. And I can also handle the smart contracts part.
7. Ai: I personally don't like this Ai madness cause. For this, my programming skills are at risk but I cannot deny the fact that it is more useful than the Blockchain madness that occurred sometime earlier. So, I somehow managed to learn this new AI tech and am currently learning...
