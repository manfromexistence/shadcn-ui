---

## Prerequisites

Before installing Roadmap UI, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), version 18 or later
- A [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) project, version 18 or later
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) installed in your project (CSS Variables only)

## Installation

You can install Roadmap UI components using the `roadmap-ui` CLI, for example:

```sh title="Terminal"
npx roadmap-ui add gantt
```

Alternatively, you can use the `shadcn` CLI and target the component JSON file, like so:

```sh title="Terminal"
npx shadcn@latest add https://www.roadmap-ui.com/gantt.json
```

This will install the Roadmap UI components into your project at `@/components/roadmap-ui` (or the relevant folder you specified in the `components.json` file).

## Usage

After installing a Roadmap UI component, you can start using it in your React application.

For example, check out the [Gantt Chart](/gantt) component.
