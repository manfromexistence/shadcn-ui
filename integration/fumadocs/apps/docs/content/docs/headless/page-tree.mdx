title: Page Tree
description: The structure of page tree.
---

Page tree is a tree structure that describes all navigation links, with other items like separator and folders.

It will be sent to the client and being referenced in navigation elements including the sidebar and breadcrumb.
Hence, you shouldn't store any sensitive or large data in page tree.

<Callout title="Note">

By design, page tree only contains necessary information of all pages and folders.

Unserializable data such as functions can't be passed to page tree.

## Conventions

This is the definitions of Page Tree, you may refer to Page Conventions to learn how to structure your folders/pages.

Certain nodes contain a `$ref` property to link to its original page/meta file, they are optional when hardcoding it.

### Root

The initial root of page trees.

<AutoTypeTable path="./content/docs/headless/props.ts" name="PageTreeRoot" />

### Page

```json
{
  "type": "page",
  "name": "Quick Start",
  "url": "/docs"
}
```

> External urls are also supported

<AutoTypeTable path="./content/docs/headless/props.ts" name="PageTreeItem" />

### Folder

```json
{
    "type": "folder",
    "name": "Guide",
    "index": {
        "type": "page",
        ...
    }
    "children": [
        ...
    ]
}
```

<AutoTypeTable path="./content/docs/headless/props.ts" name="PageTreeFolder" />

#### As Root

To implement multiple page trees, you can add a `root` property to the folder node.
This will mark the folder as a root folder, and the nearest root folder of current page will be used as the root of page tree.
Instead of showing the entire page tree, navigation elements will be restricted within the current root.

### Separator

A label between items.

```json
{
  "type": "separator",
  "name": "Components"
}
```

<AutoTypeTable
  path="./content/docs/headless/props.ts"
  name="PageTreeSeparator"
/>

## Icons

Icon is a `ReactElement`, supported by pages and folders.

## Type Bindings

You can import the type from server package.

```ts
import type { PageTree } from 'fumadocs-core/server';

const tree: PageTree.Root = {
  // props
};
```
