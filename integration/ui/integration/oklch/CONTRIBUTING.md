## Code contributing

### Run tests

Run the tests using `npm test`

### Format code

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) (with [a Husky and lint-staged precommit](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html)) to format your code automatically.

Alternatively, you can:

- trigger the pretty-printing all the files using `npm run format`
- use a [Prettier editor integration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)
