Roadmap UI is a collection of accessible, customizable, performant and open source components for building interactive roadmaps built on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). They are inspired by best-in-class tools like [Linear](https://linear.app/), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and [Plane](https://plane.so/), originally built for [Eververse](https://www.eververse.ai/).

## Key Features

- **Composable**: Components are small and focused, making them easy to customize and reuse.
- **Customizable**: Easily theme and style components to match your brand.
- **Performant**: Optimized for smooth interactions, even with large datasets.
- **Open Source**: Free to use and modify under the MIT license.

## Components

Roadmap UI offers a variety of components to suit different roadmap visualization needs:

1. **Gantt Chart**: Visualize project schedules on a horizontal timeline.
2. **Kanban Board**: Organize work items into columns representing different stages.
3. **Calendar View**: Display projects and tasks on a grid calendar.
4. **List View**: A simple, grouped list of roadmap items.
5. **Table View**: Display large amounts of data in a tabular format.
