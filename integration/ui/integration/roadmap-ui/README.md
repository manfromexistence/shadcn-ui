# Roadmap UI

Roadmap UI is a collection of accessible, customizable, performant and open source components for building interactive roadmaps built on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). They are inspired by best-in-class tools like [Linear](https://linear.app/), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and [Plane](https://plane.so/), originally built for [Eververse](https://www.eververse.ai/).

Check out the [docs](https://www.roadmap-ui.com/) to get started.
